# Student Dropout Detector

This project aims to build an AI model to predict student success in a class or a degree program. By analyzing historical data, the model identifies students at risk of dropping out, enabling proactive intervention to improve retention rates.

## Features

- Predicts student dropout likelihood using machine learning algorithms.
- Utilizes models like XGBoost and Random Forest for comparison.
- Designed for education institutions to enhance student support.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- pandas, numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/4Gedu/StudentDropOutDector.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r 
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format.
2. Data incoming from Mockaroo 
3. Run the model script:
    ```
    python DropOutModelAi.py
    ```
